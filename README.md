# Bridge.React
Bindings for [Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net/) for React - write React applications in C#!

For more information, there is a working example at [bitbucket.org/DanRoberts/reactbridgedotnet](https://bitbucket.org/DanRoberts/reactbridgedotnet/). I'm publishing this bindings-only repository on GitHub since GitHub seems to be many people's first and last port of call! Any changes, fixes or updates made to the Bitbucket example will be pulled forward here.
